# Bank-Churn-Modeling
This project includes looking at data about whether a customer has churned or not and identifying, visualizing which factors have on impact on whether a customer will churn or not. 
Then we will observe the patterns on how those factors influence the likelihood of churning using the visualizations of data and build a model which best predicts the possibility of churning the best by hyperrtuning different parameters so that the banks can take measures to reduce churning based on the model
